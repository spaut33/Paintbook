## This is work in progress project (for educational purposes mostly). Use it on your own risks, no warranties!

`Paintbook` is a catalogue of model paints (and other similar chemical stuff) widely used by scale modellers. It helps to structurize paints you own. You can see total amount of each type, add, modify and delete paints in your warehouse. 
You won't buy a paint you don't need anymore! :)

It is written on Python using Django and PostgreSQL, utilizing Django REST framework.

### Future releases

1. Add reactive frontend (vue, possibly)
2. Add social integration/Authentication (almost done)
3. Add sharing, exchange of paints between users
