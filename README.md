![Paintbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spaut33/modelpaints/master/design/logo.svg)

`Paintbook` is a catalog of model paints (and other similar chemical stuff) that are widely used by scale modellers. It helps to organize paints you own, so you can see total amount of each paint, add, modify and delete it. 
You won't buy a paint you don't need anymore! ðŸ˜†

### It is based on the following technologies:

- Django framework
- Django REST framework
- PostgreSQL
- Vue3, AlpineJS, Tailwind CSS for the frontend

### Future releases

1. Add reactive frontend (vue, possibly)
2. Add social integration/Authentication (almost done)
3. Add sharing, exchange of paints between users
